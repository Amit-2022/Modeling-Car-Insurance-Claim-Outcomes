# Modeling-Car-Insurance-Claim-Outcomes

The Head of Data at On the Road car insurance has asked for your support as they venture into the world of machine learning! They would like you to start by investigating their customer data and cleaning it in preparation for modeling. Once that is complete, they would like you to tell them which feature produces the best accuracy for predicting whether a customer will make a car insurance claim. Specifically, they have set the following tasks:

Investigate and clean the data, so that there are no missing values.
Find the feature with the best predictive performance for "outcome" by creating simple Logistic Regression models and assessing their accuracy.
Create a DataFrame called best_feature_df, containing columns named "best_feature" and "best_accuracy" with the name of the feature with the largest accuracy, and the respective accuracy score.

# How to approach the project
1. Reading in and exploring the dataset

2. Filling missing values

3. Preparing for modeling

4. Building and storing the models

5. Measuring performance

6. Finding the best performing model
